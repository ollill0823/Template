# Assignment09- Practice token and word analysis from Jupyter

[`A Midsummer Night's Dream`](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/midsummer/full.html) 
## This file will include:
1. Tokenize the words and remove stopwords
2. Find the top 20 most frequent words in the play
3. Comment on whether these words give an accurate sense of the play


If you fail to name your file correctly, `fastpages` will automatically attempt to fix the problem by prepending the last modified date of your notebook. However, it is recommended that you name your files properly yourself for more transparency.

See [Writing Blog Posts With Jupyter](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#writing-blog-posts-with-jupyter) for more details.
